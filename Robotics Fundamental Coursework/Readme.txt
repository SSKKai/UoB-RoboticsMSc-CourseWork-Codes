We encapsulate some of our task into functions:the task:
  Lynx Forward kinematic: FowKi.m
  Lynx Inverse kinematic: InvKi.m
  Lynx Free motion: FMTraj.m
  Lynx Straight line trajectory: SLTraj.m 
  Parallel inverse kinematic with figure: ParallelIKPlot.m
  Parallel inverse kinematic without figure: ParallelIK.m
  Parallel workspace as functions: ParallelWorkspace.m

And other tasks are scripts:
  Lynx workspace: workspace.m
  Lynx workspace in cross-section view: workspace_cs.m
  Lynx trajectory task: TrajectoryTask.m
  Lynx inverse kinematic function self-inspection: IKRandomCheck.m
  Lynx second way to generate straight-line trajectory: SLTraj2.m


In order to make it easier to check our code, we write a total program includes our main job and examples of functions,
Please see the document: Coursework.m

Remember make all the m document in a same folder

kind regards.
